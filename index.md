Love2D Examples
======

Some games (can you call them games? how about "interactive media") I made to teach myself, and the bros of AP Computer Science some Lua and some [LÃ¶ve Engine][0].

The source is available [on GitHub][3].

Want to run these?

1. Download a [Love2D binary][0] and a [copy of the repository][1].
2. Download and run one of my game's .love files.

Browse the annotated source of:

* [Raindrop][2]
